CapScan for Android
===================

A CapScan client for Android. The very beginning of a neat little app.

Current capabilities:
- Take a picture and display it back internally

Next functionality to implement:
- Save picture to storage and upload to a server
- Do this in the background and publish a notification on completion
- Start parsing text response from server
- Backend stuff
